    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last modified: 04/12/2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      This website is a simple, static, open-source project. It does not use cookies, analytics, tracking tools,
      or any external scripts. No personal data is stored by me when you visit the site.  
      The website is hosted by GitHub Pages, which provides the infrastructure necessary to deliver the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Controller</h2>

    <h2>Data collected when visiting the website</h2>
    <p>
      When you access this website, your browser automatically sends certain technical information to GitHub’s servers.
      This may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>The date and time of access</li>
      <li>The URL or file requested</li>
      <li>The website you came from</li>
      <li>Your browser type and version</li>
      <li>General information about your operating system</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These server logs are created and processed by GitHub. They are used to ensure the stability, security,
      and proper functioning of the hosting service.  
      I do not have access to individual log files and do not process this data independently.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal basis</h2>
    <p>
      The processing of technical data such as IP addresses when loading this website is based on legitimate interest 
      (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). This includes ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the website.
    </p>

    <h2>GitHub Pages as an external provider</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub Pages is operated by GitHub, Inc. GitHub acts as an independent controller for the processing of technical 
      data generated when hosting and delivering this website.  
      You can find details in GitHub’s privacy documentation.
    </p>

    <h2>International data transfers</h2>
    <p>
      As part of operating GitHub Pages, technical data may be processed on servers outside the European Union.
      GitHub uses safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses and participation in the Data Privacy Framework
      to ensure an adequate level of data protection.
    </p>

    <h2>How long GitHub stores log data</h2>
    <p>
      Log retention periods are determined by GitHub and may vary depending on the type of log
      (e.g., debugging, security, operational needs).  
      Since GitHub Pages does not provide retention controls to site owners, the duration is based solely on GitHub's policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For detailed and up-to-date information, please consult GitHub's privacy documentation or GitHub support.
    </p>
