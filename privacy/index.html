    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last modified: 05/12/2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      This website is a simple, static, open-source project. It does not use cookies, analytics, tracking tools,
      or any external scripts. No personal data is stored by me when you visit the site.
      The website is hosted by GitHub Pages, which provides the infrastructure necessary to deliver the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Controller</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Frauma e.K.</strong><br>
      Owner: Derin Özön<br>
      Regerstr. 13, 94469 Deggendorf, Germany<br>

    </p>

    <h2>Data collected when visiting the website</h2>
    <p>
      When you access this website, your browser automatically sends certain technical information to GitHub’s servers.
      This may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>The date and time of access</li>
      <li>The URL or file requested</li>
      <li>The website you came from</li>
      <li>Your browser type and version</li>
      <li>General information about your operating system</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These server logs are created and processed by GitHub. They are used to ensure the stability, security,
      and proper functioning of the hosting service. I do not have access to individual log files and do not
      process this data independently.
    </p>

    <h2>Joint controllership with GitHub</h2>
    <p>
      According to the case law of the European Court of Justice, operators of websites that integrate third-party
      infrastructure may be considered joint controllers with those providers regarding certain processing activities.
      For the hosting and delivery of this website, GitHub and I act as joint controllers for the initial collection
      of technical data (such as IP addresses) transmitted by your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub processes this data under its own responsibility for security and operational purposes.<br>
      For more details, see Github's privacy statement here: <strong>https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Legal basis</h2>
    <p>
      The processing of technical data such as IP addresses when loading this website is based on legitimate interest 
      (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). This includes ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the website.
    </p>

    <h2>International data transfers</h2>
    <p>
      As part of operating GitHub Pages, technical data may be processed on servers outside the European Union.
      GitHub uses safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses and participation in the Data Privacy Framework
      to ensure an adequate level of data protection.
    </p>

    <h2>How long GitHub stores log data</h2>
    <p>
      Log retention periods are determined by GitHub and may vary depending on the type of log
      (e.g., debugging, security, operational needs). Since GitHub Pages does not provide retention controls
      to site owners, the duration is based solely on GitHub's policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For detailed and up-to-date information, please consult GitHub's privacy documentation or GitHub support.
    </p>

    <h2>Rights of affected</h2>
    <p>

      rights provided under the GDPR:
    </p>

      <li>Right to rectification</li>
      <li>Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")</li>
      <li>Right to restriction of processing</li>
      <li>Right to data portability</li>
      <li>Right to object</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to complain to a
      supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your place of residence, employment or the place of
      the alleged infringement, if you believe that the processing of personal data violates data protection law.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you contact me by email, the data you provide (such as your name, email address, and message content)
      will be processed for the purpose of responding to your inquiry. The legal basis is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR - legitimate interest in communicating with users, and</li>
      <li>Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR - initiating or executing contractual relations, where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Emails are stored on the servers of my email provider GoDaddy.<br>
      For more details, see GoDaddy's privacy statement here: <strong>https://www.godaddy.com/legal/agreements/privacy-policy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Business-relevant communication (e.g., contract-related inquiries or legally required documentation)
      is stored for at least 10 years in accordance with statutory retention obligations.  
      Other communication is deleted once it is no longer needed to process your request.
